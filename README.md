# Sentiment Analysis Restaurant Reviews
The purpose of this analysis is to build a prediction model to predict whether a review on the restaurant is positive or negative. To do so, we will work on Restaurant Review dataset, we will load it into predicitve algorithms Multinomial Naive Bayes, Bernoulli Naive Bayes and Logistic Regression.

Dataset: Restaurant_Reviews.tsv is a dataset from Kaggle datasets which consists of 1000 reviews on a restaurant.

Using Multinomial Naive Bayes,
- Accuracy score is: 76.5%
- Precision score is: 0.76
- Recall score is: 0.79

Using Bernoulli Naive Bayes,
- Accuracy score is: 77.5%
- Precision score is: 0.77
- Recall score is: 0.8

Using Logistic Regression,
- Accuracy score is: 72.0%
- Precision score is: 0.76
- Recall score is: 0.67

From the above results, Bernoulli Naive Bayes is  slightly better method compared to Multinomial Naive Bayes and Logistic Regression, with 77.5% accuracy which means the model built for the prediction of sentiment of the restaurant review gives 77.5% right prediction.
